## 🎯 Project Overview
This project captures **real-time Twitch chat data** using **AWS Kinesis and Lambda** and processes it for analysis.  
The goal is to detect clippable moments based on **chat spikes and keyword detection**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Flask** (for local Twitch chat processing)
- **AWS Kinesis** (for real-time streaming)
- **AWS Lambda** (for chat event processing)
- **Twitch API** (for authentication and clip creation)

## 🔜 Next step for further development of the app:
- Save detected clips to S3 for further analysis
- Have clips displayed with some UI implementation
